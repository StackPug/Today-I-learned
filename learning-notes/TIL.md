Today I learned

27th November 2025

Today I learned more about what happened last night when I tried to add an about me to my website. I have learnt the HTML basics from Free Code Camp on what to add to the website and how to add a nav (navigation) bar. I added one for the about me section. Eventually I will make it so it opens a new page, but I got lost in the GITHub hole and really enjoyed how it kept breaking. I learnt that it wouldn't push it because of the changes made and it opened VIM which I had no idea how to get out of. Since learned ESC, :wq means save and quit. I also learned that git commit -m "ENTER MESSAGE HERE" is how I can name my file/commit without it opening VIM and confusing me. 
I am currently making a new repo called "Today I learned" and think this is a cool way for me to jot down what I have learned everyday and keep a diary. I have tried doing this the old fashioned way with paper and pen but I love this idea of keeping it digital and it will also count to me being active on GITHub. 
So in doing this I have learnt that mkdir means make directory and then you put the name you would like it to be. I have learned that TOUCH and a name you put here, opens a new notes file but if it is a name that is already taken it will open and update that version. 
git init - initialised git repo
git add TIL.md - added the file
git commit -m "Add first TIL notes" - saved as 
I carried on and learnt how to make folders but then decided I didn't need lots of folders and one notes file is enough so I learned how to delete them. 
rm r (foldername) deletes a folder and files in it
rm (filename) deletes a file

Today I started with updating my website. I added a footer element, made a new, seperate page for my about-me to open up when you click on it and changed the style of the nav bar. I did the footer and the about me page myself but, I had to find out how to style the nav bar as it's CSS which I havent done yet. 
Mistakes were made but, that is how we learn. I left the # on the about-me so the href didn't work. I also put the footer element outside of the body. I missed a closed section tag that I needed to delete. 
I tidied up the header tags as I had more than one H1 which is frowned upon. I am sure I will make that look better as I learn CSS.

Wow, what a day I am having. Last night I decided I would like to make my own business. I thought long and hard about a brand name and I came up with one I love. I designed a logo, claimed all the social media handles/usernames. I will look into securing the domain soon. This morning I woke up determined to make my own business website. I have been on here for hours and hours and I only have my logo spanning the width of the page, but I have learnt so much in the process. I now have a CSS file which I am styling the website from and so I am learning how to set up the header, logo etc with that. I got the logo spanning the width corectly then I noticed a white bar/gap above it and I learnt that the browser will always default a margin of 8 and we have to set that margin to 0. I am learning so much about the parent child relationship. I learnt exactly what divs are and how they are used. Finding myself having this real reason to code so I can promote my business and build for others has given me a non stop thirst for learning. I have just learnt how to make a :root variable which is a global variable and assigned it to my sites colour. Now I have changed the colour codes, if i change my mind on the sites colour I can just go straight to the root and it will change all the others accordingly.

Today I am back on the brand website. I have added a footer with a trademark for the brand. I am continuing with CSS on FCC and asking Chat GPT questions as I see fit. I noticed how I have been using CSS there has been a "full stop" before the selector and I asked why this is. If you are styling an HTML tag like h1, there’s no full stop.
A full stop means it is a class, which means the element in HTML has a class attribute that relates to the class in CSS. I completed 89 tasks on FCC making a menu card which I really enjoyed. I used some of the code on my own website to change my a:active on my nav links to blue. I learnt a few things like how to have backup font and add images and change the margin to -negative to help it move closer to the h1 or h2 tags.

Today I have continued on FCC and made a business card. I am really enjoying seeing CSS and how it works. It is a lot more visually interesting than simply HTML alone. I just know I am going to enjoy implementing javascript even more. I changed my "a" link states on my brand website. They are white when you hover and change to pink when you click on them. I keep them charcoal other than that as it is the most asthetically pleasing. I am on 106 steps out of 1153 until I can get the responsive web certificate and move on the Javascript.

I couldn't code yesterday as I had to catch up on house work. I am trying to keep track of the actual time I am getting in so I am using visual timer. I have done 2 hours so far today working on FCC CSS. I made a todo list. I couldn't figure out how to make a nested list and that is because I haven't made one yet. I have found that FCC will ask things of me that I haven't learnt yet. I just ask Chat GPT and then I try to add the code in and correct myself without copying and pasting. So today I guess I have learned how to nest lists and target putting a border around the beginning of the list only as the second list element kept having a border around that one and the code I had to use was .todo-list > li, this targetted the first child of the list. I then decided to make the nav bar font larger on my brand website and made the whole background-color the same as the nav bar. I noticed I hadnt changed the root color for the footer so I changed that. Im on 11 out of now 1190 :|. It has gone up ! Oh well. I'll keep going. I learnt how to do border-radius so I changed the borders on my original website and it was funny going back because I can see all the things I can change now !
