Today I learned

27th November 2025

Today I learned more about what happened last night when I tried to add an about me to my website. I have learnt the HTML basics from Free Code Camp on what to add to the website and how to add a nav (navigation) bar. I added one for the about me section. Eventually I will make it so it opens a new page, but I got lost in the GITHub hole and really enjoyed how it kept breaking. I learnt that it wouldn't push it because of the changes made and it opened VIM which I had no idea how to get out of. Since learned ESC, :wq means save and quit. I also learned that git commit -m "ENTER MESSAGE HERE" is how I can name my file/commit without it opening VIM and confusing me. 
I am currently making a new repo called "Today I learned" and think this is a cool way for me to jot down what I have learned everyday and keep a diary. I have tried doing this the old fashioned way with paper and pen but I love this idea of keeping it digital and it will also count to me being active on GITHub. 
So in doing this I have learnt that mkdir means make directory and then you put the name you would like it to be. I have learned that TOUCH and a name you put here, opens a new notes file but if it is a name that is already taken it will open and update that version. 
git init - initialised git repo
git add TIL.md - added the file
git commit -m "Add first TIL notes" - saved as 
I carried on and learnt how to make folders but then decided I didn't need lots of folders and one notes file is enough so I learned how to delete them. 
rm r (foldername) deletes a folder and files in it
rm (filename) deletes a file

Today I started with updating my website. I added a footer element, made a new, seperate page for my about-me to open up when you click on it and changed the style of the nav bar. I did the footer and the about me page myself but, I had to find out how to style the nav bar as it's CSS which I havent done yet. 
Mistakes were made but, that is how we learn. I left the # on the about-me so the href didn't work. I also put the footer element outside of the body. I missed a closed section tag that I needed to delete. 
I tidied up the header tags as I had more than one H1 which is frowned upon. I am sure I will make that look better as I learn CSS.
