Today I learned

27th November 25'

Today I learned more about what happened last night when I tried to add an about me to my website. I have learnt the HTML basics from Free Code Camp on what to add to the website and how to add a nav (navigation) bar. I added one for the about me section. Eventually I will make it so it opens a new page, but I got lost in the GITHub hole and really enjoyed how it kept breaking. I learnt that it wouldn't push it because of the changes made and it opened VIM which I had no idea how to get out of. Since learned ESC, :wq means save and quit. I also learned that git commit -m "ENTER MESSAGE HERE" is how I can name my file/commit without it opening VIM and confusing me. 
I am currently making a new repo called "Today I learned" and think this is a cool way for me to jot down what I have learned everyday and keep a diary. I have tried doing this the old fashioned way with paper and pen but I love this idea of keeping it digital and it will also count to me being active on GITHub. 
So in doing this I have learnt that mkdir means make directory and then you put the name you would like it to be. I have learned that TOUCH and a name you put here, opens a new notes file but if it is a name that is already taken it will open and update that version. 
git init - initialised git repo
git add TIL.md - added the file
git commit -m "Add first TIL notes" - saved as 
I carried on and learnt how to make folders but then decided I didn't need lots of folders and one notes file is enough so I learned how to delete them. 
rm r (foldername) deletes a folder and files in it
rm (filename) deletes a file

Today I started with updating my website. I added a footer element, made a new, seperate page for my about-me to open up when you click on it and changed the style of the nav bar. I did the footer and the about me page myself but, I had to find out how to style the nav bar as it's CSS which I havent done yet. 
Mistakes were made but, that is how we learn. I left the # on the about-me so the href didn't work. I also put the footer element outside of the body. I missed a closed section tag that I needed to delete. 
I tidied up the header tags as I had more than one H1 which is frowned upon. I am sure I will make that look better as I learn CSS. I was about to push this and I learnt that it was not saved in the GITHub repo folder so i learnt to move this to that folder via mv ~/TIL.md . I then pressed ls to check it was present, then I am free to 
git add TIL.md
git commit -m "Add TIL notes"
git push

Today I updated my about-me and coding journey paragraphs. I wanted to try making a form because I felt as if I hadn't done enough of that and needed a little refresher and put my own form on my page. I decided to make a contact-me.html and add a form on there. I remembered about adding a fieldset and legend, then the type, id and name and even that I would need a min, max, placeholder and required for the input! I just wasn't sure how to write the legend part so I asked Chat GPT to help a little. When it tells me what I will be doing next I always attempt it first then I get it to tell me how close I was rather than copying it all and not learning anything. That is the hard thing about teaching yourself, you are only cheating yourself if you aren't actively trying and testing yourself. I discovered that when I add all of that input nice and neatly on multilines, it saves and bunches it all back up to one line which I think looks messy. I asked Chat GPT if there is a way to make it so it goes one after the other under the input element and it said I need to go to settings and find force-expand-multiline. I sorted this.
I have also added a things i love.html. I have to say I am so happy with how my navigation bar works. It fills me with so much joy that when you click on the links they work!
So today I have added a name input, email input and a message input to my contact form. Made two new files, and learnt how to change my syntax to multilines.

Today I started by adding some images to my main index.html page and the things i love page. They came out quite large so I had to add a style (in line text) to make it smaller. I am still trying to avoid any CSS for now so I can max out what can be done just using HTML. One was taller than the other so then i learnt about adding the height and object-fit:cover; This worked great. I then asked Chat GPT how I can max out what there is to learn with HTML. I tidied up my code by adding a header and main element. 
I added a books and games header to things i love and I linked my good reads profile to the goodreads logo. The file was confusing me as I didn't notice it was a JPEG instead of JPG. It didn't take me long to figure it out.

I noticed that the second photo of my pug wasn't showing on the webpage so i copied and pasted code to Chat GPt and it told me the closing "a" tag was missing. I chose to ask instead of spend lots of my time looking as I beleive AI will usually be able to help us get a lot of things done quicker. I did have the closing tag I know its not a void element so the fact I have learnt that helps me move forward quicker. 
I asked Chat GPT what else I can use using only HTML. I played around with the details element with summary and paragraph. I decided not to keep this on my page but, I enjoyed seeing what it could do. I added figure elements and figcaptions to all of my images. 

Saturday 6th December 25'

I've had a few days off from actively coding. I have listened to three episodes of the Free Code Camp podcast. I enjoy these so much because I always get some great tips and advice and it keeps me going and thinking like a dev.
I am on number 229/276 of HTML on FCC Responsive Web Design Certification. I have been struggling to find the motivation to carry on with home life at the moment. Being a mother to 2 children and a wife, home life comes first and I have to put my learning aside sometimes. And that's ok. 

Sunday 7th December 25'

Today I don't have a lot of time so I decided to add a submit button to my contact form and Chat GPT taught me to link it to a formspree which will send responses to my email address. It also tidied up the form and made it look a lot nicer. I can see how easy it would be to just get Chat GPT to make the whole thing but i'm taking it slow and building it myself then learning how to change it and add things that I don't know about.  

Monday 8th December 25'

Today I completed some more of HTML on FCC. I am on 259/276. I am hoping I can get this finished tomorrow and start on CSS. I am really excited for that and to see how much I can imporve my website. I have felt some imposter syndrome today, worried about how I don't have as much time as everyone else but I am not going to stop. 

Tuesday 9th December 25'

I didn't get the HTML complete but I am so close. I have a lot more time tomorrow so I am hoping to get a good few hours in. Today I learnt about more ways to make websites accessible including, aria-hidden, aria-describedby.

Wednesday 10th December 25'

I finished the HTML part and then I completed the extra computing section that has been added in since I started. I have begun CSS and I am so excited to put it to the test on my website. As it is the christmas period fast approaching and I have two young children, I won't be able to sit and code as much as I would like and that's ok because they won't always be this young. I will dedicate what time I can. I have a book I want to read called "She's in CTRL" by Anne Marie Imafidon. And I will listen to Free Code Camps new podcast on Friday. I need to find some other tech related pod casts to listen to. 

Friday 12th December 25'

Today I am on CSS on FCC. I am reading through some basics of HTML that I do know already but one thing that I noticed I haven't seen before is the <hr> element. I went straight to my webpage and added it in and I am so chuffed honeslty, this is how I know I am meant to code. I love these new things I can add, no matter how small. As I carried on learning I also noticed I like the border around the images so I added that to my page. It didn't work on one photo and I wasn't sure why but it was that I had an image without a figure element so I wrapped figire around the image. I then added iframe into it so it wrapped around my video. 

Saturday 13th December 25'

Wow, what a day I am having. Last night I decided I would like to make my own business. I thought long and hard about a brand name and I came up with one I love. I designed a logo, claimed all the social media handles/usernames. I will look into securing the domain soon. This morning I woke up determined to make my own business website. I have been on here for hours and hours and I only have my logo spanning the width of the page, but I have learnt so much in the process. I now have a CSS file which I am styling the website from and so I am learning how to set up the header, logo etc with that. I got the logo spanning the width corectly then I noticed a white bar/gap above it and I learnt that the browser will always default a margin of 8 and we have to set that margin to 0. I am learning so much about the parent child relationship. I learnt exactly what divs are and how they are used. Finding myself having this real reason to code so I can promote my business and build for others has given me a non stop thirst for learning. I have just learnt how to make a :root variable which is a global variable and assigned it to my sites colour. Now I have changed the colour codes, if i change my mind on the sites colour I can just go straight to the root and it will change all the others accordingly. 

Sunday 14th December 25'

Today I am back on the brand website. I have added a footer with a trademark for the brand. I am continuing with CSS on FCC and asking Chat GPT questions as I see fit. I noticed how I have been using CSS there has been a "full stop" before the selector and I asked why this is. If you are styling an HTML tag like h1, there’s no full stop.
A full stop means it is a class, which means the element in HTML has a class attribute that relates to the class in CSS. I completed 89 tasks on FCC making a menu card which I really enjoyed. I used some of the code on my own website to change my a:active on my nav links to blue. I learnt a few things like how to have backup font and add images and change the margin to -negative to help it move closer to the h1 or h2 tags. 

Monday 15th December 25'

Today I have continued on FCC and made a business card. I am really enjoying seeing CSS and how it works. It is a lot more visually interesting than simply HTML alone. I just know I am going to enjoy implementing javascript even more. I changed my "a" link states on my brand website. They are white when you hover and change to pink when you click on them. I keep them charcoal other than that as it is the most asthetically pleasing. I am on 106 steps out of 1153 until I can get the responsive web certificate and move on the Javascript. 

Wednesday 17th December 25'

I couldn't code yesterday as I had to catch up on house work. I am trying to keep track of the actual time I am getting in so I am using visual timer. I have done 2 hours so far today working on FCC CSS. I made a todo list. I couldn't figure out how to make a nested list and that is because I haven't made one yet. I have found that FCC will ask things of me that I haven't learnt yet. I just ask Chat GPT and then I try to add the code in and correct myself without copying and pasting. So today I guess I have learned how to nest lists and target putting a border around the beginning of the list only as the second list element kept having a border around that one and the code I had to use was .todo-list > li, this targetted the first child of the list. I then decided to make the nav bar font larger on my brand website and made the whole background-color the same as the nav bar. I noticed I hadnt changed the root color for the footer so I changed that. Im on 11 out of now 1190 :|. It has gone up ! Oh well. I'll keep going. I learnt how to do border-radius so I changed the borders on my original website and it was funny going back because I can see all the things I can change now !

Thursday 1st January 26'

Today I have only been able to complete a few tasks on the FCC site. I have been learning about user centered design, cards and what info is important and how to make it stand out. I am hoping I can fit in as much coding as possible but while the kids are off I wont have as much time as I'd like right now. 

Friday 2nd January 26'

Continuing FCC. I have learnt about Figma and downloaded this. I am looking forward to playing about with this. Sketch for mac and Adobe XD. I am on 142/1191. It is a little overwhelming but I am not going to stop. Learning like this means I am learning nonetheless. I hope to put in a lot more hours from Monday. I wish I could have a set time of hours and know how long it is going to take me but the life of a parent isn't so simple. I now have a desk and I am looking for a second screen.  

Saturday 3rd January 26'

Today I have spent an hour n half going through more of FCC. Today though I am at a small standstill as I am having trouble understanding the absolute/relative units. The parent/child relationship with em and rem. I haven't been able to visualise it from just reading it so tomorrow I plan to play around with it in codepen and hope I can pick it up quickly before moving on. I think a lot of it is to do with all this new language that is just not in my vocab yet so I need to factor that in too. I am not stupid I am just learning so much.
